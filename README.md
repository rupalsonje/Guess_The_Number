# Guess_The_Number

The game is single person game.
The player thinks of an integer within a range (1-100).
If player guess is more than 10 away from my number, I'll tell you you're COLD.
If player guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're WARM.
If player's next guess is farther than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting COLDER.
If player's next guess is closer than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting WARMER
